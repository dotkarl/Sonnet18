# Sonnet18

This project contains code that generates William Shakespeare's famous Sonnet 18 (also known as *Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?*).

However, in a very real sense, that is not at all the purpose of the code at hand.

This project's `Program.cs` file is meant to be read just like a poem. 


## Beauty

This project is an exercise in crafting beautiful code. It invites the reader to reflect on the standards of beauty in coding and poetry.


## Invitation

I happily invite other coders to see if they can do a better job writing a program that satisfies these two conditions:

1. It generates an existing poem by code.

2. The source code itself is written in such a way that it could be read as poetry.
